## E-Commerce Back-End

The growth of E-Commerce in recent times is certainly undoubted, and the ability to construct a scalable, maintainable platform can potentially improve the business conducted by a startup / established company. I'm taking the time over my summer break to learn more about the MERN stack, gain practical experience and hopefully develop a working E-Commerce application from scratch.

This technologies used in this project are NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB.
